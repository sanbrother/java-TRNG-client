Optional: 
 Jakarta commons-loggin library, downloadable from http://commons.apache.org/logging/

---------


Changes in v1.0
 - Add support for QRBG from Ruder Boskovic Institute 
 - Update www.random.org certificate
  
Changes in v0.2
 - Add proxy for org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory (avoiding direct dependency on the library)
 - Fix endless loop when RjgodoyProvider is the default provider and a PRNG is used
 - Remove duplicate log messages in MH_SecureRandomSpi constructor and RjgodoyProvider
 - Fix issue when loading certificate from JAR file   
 
Changes in v0.1
 - Add trim() in MH_HttpCient.checkQuota()
 
Known Bugs
 - when using SSL, the KeyGenerator uses the default SecureRandom.
   this blocks if we are the default SecureRandom. This behaviour cannot be overriden
   using Java API.
